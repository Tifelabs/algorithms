#Chapter 1 (BINARY SEARCH)
""" 
 Binary Search is an algorithm; its inputs is 
 sorted to the list of elements.
"""

#NOTE 1
""" 
With Binary Search, you guess the middle number and
eliminate half the remaining numbers every time
"""
#NOTE 2
""" 
for any list of n binary search will take log2n steps to run 
in the worst case, whereas simple search will take n steps
 """
#NOTE 3
""" 
Binary search only works when your list is in a sorted order.
