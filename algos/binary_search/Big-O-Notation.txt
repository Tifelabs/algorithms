>BIG O Notation
    Big O Notation tells how fast an Algorithm is.

#NOTE: Algorithms running times grow at different rates.

#NOTE2:
    Big O notation tells you how fast an algorithm is. For
    example, suppose you have a list of size n. Simple search
    needs to check each element, so it will take n operations. The
    run time in Big O notation is O(n). Where are the seconds?
    There are none—Big O doesn’t tell you the speed in seconds.
    Big O notation lets you compare the number of operations. It
    tells you how fast the algorithm grows.
